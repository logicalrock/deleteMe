# Footprint Scrubber

Footprint Scrubber helps you erase your digital footprint with or without paid data‑removal services.

# Key Features

- Paid‑Service Awareness – Detects your subscriptions (Incogni, DeleteMe, Kanary, Optery, OneRep) and skips brokers they already cover.
- Free Resource Launcher – Opens popular free opt‑out aggregators (SimpleOptOut, JustDelete.me, StopDataBrokers).
- Encrypted Personal Data – Uses `cryptography` (optional) to store your identifiers locally.
- CSV‑Driven Broker List – Manage hundreds of brokers in `brokers.csv` with `covered_by` + `status` columns.
- Email & URL Automation – One‑click opt‑out links and pre‑drafted email templates for brokers needing email requests.

# Setup

```bash
pip install cryptography   # optional but recommended
python3 footprint_scrubber.py
```

# First‑Run Wizard
1. Choose your paid services (Incogni, DeleteMe, Kanary, Optery, OneRep).  
2. Decide whether to integrate (free / open‑source) resources.  
3. Preferences save to `scrubber_config.json`.
